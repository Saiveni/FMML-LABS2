        "2.Does it give more accurate estimate of test accuracy? One common reason is overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model becomes too complex and starts to fit the noise in the training data rather than the underlying patterns. As a result, the model may have high training accuracy but low validation accuracy."

        "3.What is the effect of the number of iterations on the estimate? Do we get a better estimate with higher iterations? The step size and number of iterations that you specify for solvers in your model affect the speed and accuracy of your real-time simulation. If you decrease the step size or increase the number of iterations, the results are more accurate, but the simulation runs slower."

In some cases, data augmentation can lead to higher validation accuracy than training accuracy. This is because the augmented data is not used during training, so the model may perform better on this new data. Finally, higher validation accuracy can also occur due to the use of regularization techniques."
